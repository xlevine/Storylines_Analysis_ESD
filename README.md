# Storylines Analysis
Code to generate storylines of climate change for the Arctic. This code is associated with a manuscript under review at Earth System Dynamics: "Storylines of Summer Arctic climate change constrained by Barents-Kara Sea and Arctic tropospheric warming for climate risks assessment" (Levine et al.)

Toolbox.py : contains basic computing functions for all scripts
Set_Grid.py: defines regions, and spatial averaging functions
empirical_clustering.py : defines PCA and MCA for empirical storylines (Appendix A)
Master.py : Main code for generating storylines
plot_Storylines.py: Main code for plotting storylines
